To committers, a word on style:

Yes, this is Ruby, and Rubyists love their duck typing. However, as it is in
Objective-C development on the Mac and iOS; the high majority of methods,
classes, and messages you're going to be sending are to the methods, classes,
and messages that Apple provides, which are written in *camelCase*. So wherever
possible I find is highly advisable, for consistency wise at least, to write
your own code in camelCase as well, for MacRuby development anyway.
